## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Library Management System using **SQL** and an **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Diagram** to manage book borrowing, transactions, and fines efficiently.

It provides a structured approach to:
- Book inventory tracking
- User management (Borrowers, Librarians)
- Transaction and fine handling
- Data-driven analytics for library improvements

## 🏗️ Features
- **EER Diagram Design:**
  - Entities: `Books`, `Borrowers`, `Librarians`, `Transactions`, `Fines`
  - Clear relationships to ensure data integrity.
  
- **Database Operations:**
  - Normalized relational database schema for optimized performance.
  - SQL scripts for table creation, data insertion, and complex queries.
  
- **Automation:**
  - SQL Triggers to automatically update inventory.
  - Stored Procedures for fine calculations and overdue notifications.

- **Analytics:**
  - Advanced SQL queries using `JOINs`, subqueries, and aggregation to analyze borrowing patterns and overdue behavior.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **EER Diagram Tools** (Draw.io / dbdiagram.io)
- **BeautifulSoup (for future extensions if web scraping integration is added)**

## 📊 Benefits
- **Optimized Inventory Management:** Seamless tracking of books and transactions.
- **Enhanced Borrower Experience:** Easy book searches, due date tracking, and recommendations.
- **Automated Operations:** Reduced manual work through triggers and procedures.
- **Actionable Insights:** Data-driven decisions based on borrowing trends.

## 🧠 Learnings
- Hands-on experience with relational database design.
- Complex SQL queries and data analytics.
- Building automated workflows inside a database.

## ✨ Future Enhancements
- Develop a web-based front-end for user and admin interactions.
- Implement a recommendation system based on genres and user history.
- Add role-based login system for Librarians and Borrowers.
